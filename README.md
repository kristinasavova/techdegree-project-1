 My Random Quote Generator contains quotes from some famous books. 

 What I found the most difficult, was using the setInterval() method to update quotes without pressing a button. I had to google a lot to get some ideas how to do it. 
 
 It was a great pleasure to work on functions that provide changing of the backgoround color, getting a random quote and on the conditional statements.
